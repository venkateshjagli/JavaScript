->Variables ?
	In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
	JavaScript uses the var keyword to declare variables
->Data Types ?
	JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more:
->Functions ?
	A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
	A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
	JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
->Objects ?
	In real life, a car is an object.
->Properties ?
 	A car has properties like weight and color.
->Methods ?
	methods like start and stop.
->Events ?
	Event handlers can be used to handle, and verify, user input, user actions, and browser actions:
	Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
->String ?
	JavaScript strings are used for storing and manipulating text.
->StringMethods ?
	The two methods, indexOf() and search(), are equal?
	slice(start, end)
	substring(start, end)
	substr(start, length)
	substr() is similar to slice().
	replace()
	toUpperCase()
	toLowerCase()
	concat()
	trim()
	split()
->Numbers ?
	JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals.	
	toString()	
	toExponential()
	toFixed()
	toPrecision()
	valueOf()
	Number()
	parseFloat()
	parseInt()
->Array ?
	JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
	An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
->ArrayMethods	
	toString()
	join()
	pop()
	push()
	shift()
	unshift()
	splice()
	concat()
	slice()
->ArraySort
	sort()
	reverse()
	Math.max.apply()
	Math.min.apply()
-ArrayIteration
	forEach()
	map()
	filter()
	reduce()
	reduceRight()
	every()
	some()
	find()
	findIndex()
		
->Math Object
	The JavaScript Math object allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.
	Math.round()
	Math.pow()
	Math.sqrt()
	Math.abs()
	Math.ceil()
	Math.floor()
	Math.sin()
	Math.cos()
	Math.min() and Math.max()
	Math.random()
->Switch Statement
	The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
	Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.
->Loop for
	Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.
	Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
